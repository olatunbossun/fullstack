# fullstack
I’ve recently started documenting my work as a full stack developer on GitHub. Previously, I wasn’t able to share my past work due to confidentiality with former employers and personal projects. Now, my repositories showcase various projects, including web applications, APIs, and system integrations, spanning both frontend and backend technologies.

Through this documentation, I aim to provide a clear view of my development process, architecture decisions, and coding practices. Feel free to explore my repositories to see the technologies I’ve worked with, such as JavaScript, React, Node.js, .NET, Java, and cloud-based platforms like AWS. Each project includes a comprehensive README detailing the purpose, setup instructions, and key technical aspects.
